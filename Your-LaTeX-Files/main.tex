\section{Why LaTeX is Amazing}
{There exist a lot of reasons why LaTeX is an amazing utility. This assignment hopes to detail a few of these reasons.}
\subsection{It is not Microsoft Word}
{LaTeX is completely free to use! The same cannot be said about Microsoft Word.}
\subsection{There are tons of packages!}
{With LaTeX, you can install hundreds of packages to use with your document. This gives you a great degree of customization that isn’t found with word processors. The possibilities are endless, “All you need is a box, and imagination.”}
