\subsection{Typing Code}
{Since LaTeX is often used in mathematics and science, there is an easy way to type code. There are a few different ways to achieve this,
but here we are using \underline{verbatim} like this\ldots}
\begin{verbatim}
    System.out.println("Hello World");
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Mathematic Features}
{Probably the best feature of LaTeX is the ease in creating mathematical expressions. This is likely the reason why it is so widespread
in the mathematics and computer science research community.}
